About Sovellus

This application aims at bulding a map where you can easily search movies by name, genre, length, release year
or actor while also offering a chance to discover movies just by browsing the map. We hope that this application
introduces new movies for you to watch or lets you rediscover some of your old favourites.

The map is sorted by genres, each genre having a specific colour. Explanation for these colours can be found by
clicking the 'Colours' button at the bottom of the map. Each movie is represented as a circle in the map and the
size of the circle represents the popularity of that movie. Popularity is based on the data we are using.

The Data

The data we are using was parsed for the use of this application and it consists of the following files:

mapdata.json: File that contains all the information we need for maintaining the map including coordinates, IDs,
titles, sizes and genres. Genres in this file are more specific and contain some combinations for the purpose of
finding one genre for each movie to represent the colour.

parsedmovies.json: File that contains the actual data about the movies, including name, genres,
summaries and many others. This file also includes producers, writers, directors and some of the actors.
This data is used when displaying the full information of the movie after clicking it.

The data we are using is not guaranteed to be precise and we do not
take any responsibility about the factuality of this data.

Acknowledgements

The dataset we are using was generated from The Movie Database API.
This product uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
Their API also provides access to data on many additional
movies, actors and actresses, crew members, and TV shows.
