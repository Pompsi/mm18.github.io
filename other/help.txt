What this application is about

This map represents the popularity and genre of approximately 5000 movies.
The popularity is represented by circles of varying sizes and genres are
specified by the colour of these circles.

This application aims at bulding a map where you can easily
search movies by name, genre, length, release year or actor while also
offering a chance to discover movies just by browsing the map. We hope
that this application introduces new movies for you to watch or lets you
rediscover some of your old favourites.
This project is non-commercial and does not make any money. 

About the data

The data we are using is not guaranteed to be precise and we do not
take any responsibility about the factuality of this data.
For example some of the movies have a runtime length of 0 and some
popular movies have really low popularity which has an influence
on the size of the circles.

How to use this application

You can open and close the navigation/search panel from the top left
corner of the page. From there you have several options how to filter
the map to suit your needs. From top to bottom you have option to
search movies by name, genre, actor(s), release year and length of
the movie. (You can use one of these after another to filter the
results even further if you want.)

The map itself represents the movies as circles of various different
colours and each of these represent one of the genres you can find by
clicking the 'Colours' button at the bottom of the map. The size of
the circles represent the popularity of movies which is based on the
data we are using.

You can see more information about the movie you want by clicking the
circle that represents it. After that you can see various information
about the movie in the information panel that opens.
